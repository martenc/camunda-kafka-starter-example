## Architecture
====
The architecture diagram below generically demonstrates the possibilities and patterns interacting with the workflow. It's worth noting this is not a top-down model for interacting with the workflow, merely one possible approach and patterns that can be generally applied.

Aync and synchronous interaction with the engine is possible and should be considered carefully based on the business and technical requirements of the use-case.

- The green bar signifies kafka. Events are published to kafka from the workflow. The implementation for the publishers can be in . This pattern works well as we can utilize the Delegate and the Send task to control the execution of the workflow and potentially ack kafka  and handle incidents when Publishing fails.

- Green lines signify publishing of asynchronous messages from the workflow.

- The orange boxes signify components that sub-scribe to kafka and update other components based on the Events that they receive.

- Orange lines signify subscription from external systems to Kafaka topics for various purposes.

- The blue boxes signify components that do specific work and are potentially interact with the subscription components in yellow. Or could interact more synchronously with the workflow, though often through an abstraction layer.

- Purple lines and events signify point-to-point synchronous HTTP/REST interactions with the workflow and other components.

NOTE: An important takeaway is that different patterns for interactions with the workflow are possible and often desirable. It can make sense to have a orchestrated approach in some cases and a choreographed approach in other cases within the same workflow or broader use-case.

NOTE: This is a typical pattern for micro-service architectures though the level of abstraction between components will vary from use-case to use-case.

### Abstraction Layers

Another important requirement is to integrate with other systems such as UI, entitlement, authorization and authentication, as well as other legacy systems. To meet this requirement it's often desirable to have an abstraction layer around Camunda. This abstraction layer can include several different technologies include custom REST API's, Kafka, API aggregation tools like MuleSoft, GraphQL, caching technologies such as Hazelcast and others depending on your use-case. There really is no limitations with Camunda.

### Architecture Patterns
#### COMMAND
====
Spring REST controllers can be used to post data to the workflow. Simple and concise API's are defined should be deifned for interaction with the process. See `WorkflowController.java` The API always takes an object and returns and HTTP Status. The RESTful endpoint context mapping is associated to Commands that can happen in the system. Such as START, APPROVE and REJECT and intended to work in a point-to-point(request/response) synchronous fashion.

The controllers only write POST/PUT data CREATING and UPDATING only.

TIP: The intention is to create a https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html#:~:text=CQRS%20stands%20for%20Command%20Query,you%20use%20to%20read%20information[CQRS(Command Query Responsibility Segregation)] pattern for interaction. This can increase scalability while reducing complexity in distributed systems. The takeaway is to create data-stores that are optimized for different types of interactions primarily writing and reading.

#### QUERY
====
A separate API and logically separate data-store is used to query business data. Updates to this data-store always happen in an asynchronous fashion. For example when a Approval task in the work flow completes the workflow publishes an UPDATE-SERVICE-REQUEST event. The subscriber reads the event and decides what to do. In certain cases it updates the object in the data-store. Other components can now read from the data-store such as the UI.

We can guarantee the data is published to the data store with the workflow. See the section above on the JavaDelegates that implement the publishing functionality.

https://spring.io/blog/2011/02/10/getting-started-with-spring-data-jpa[Spring Data JPA] is the technology used for the ServiceRequest data. Spring Data allows for an easy way to create API's that are easy for a UI to query. Also an easy way to combine data into a useful form for the UI to consume.

## Chubb PoC Goals
- [x] *Identify gaps in Camunda* (Hopefully the PoC itself provided the context for this goal)
- [x] *Pros and Cons of forms with Camunda* (Discussed need for custom UI integration, forms integration with Camunda is flexible and allows the use of third party form frameworks. See <<ui-integration, Example UI Integration>>)
- [x] *Integration with custom UI* (See <<ui-integration, Example UI Integration>> and the <<custom-triage-tasks, Custom Traige Tasks>>)
- [x] *Case managemet with Camunda and BPMN* (See <<ui-integration, Example UI Integration>> and the <<interesting-point-workflow, Case Management use-case>>)
- [x] *Integration with Kafka* (See <<kafka-integration, Kafak Integration>>)
- [x] *Business Data Integration* (See <<business-data-in-workflow, Handling Business Data in Workflows>>)
- [x] *Reporting, metrics and capturing history events* (Demoed Optimize see <<use-case-integrations-summary, Integrations>> for more on metrics and capturing events)
- [x] *Email integration with intake framework* (This was completely mocked with Postman due to the complexity of the integration)
